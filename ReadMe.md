Make sure the TEST and TRAIN TIMIT folders are in the same directory as the RNN, CountPhones, and Patternnet files.

If you want to run an RNN, run the CreateRNN.m file first, then run the RunRNN.m file next.

If you want to run a Patternnet, just run any .m file.

These are the basic files of my experimentation. If you want to see my other, slightly different attempts, I can put those up as well.

A prototype has been added, to show what the sponsors will see when they use our product.

You can also count phones using the CountPhones.m file.
